							<h2>1. Problem Definition / Objective</h2>
							<p>What was the business problem or challenge? </br>
								What was the specific objective of the project? </br>
								Why was this important for the business or organization?</p>
							
							<h2>2. Data Available</h2>
							<p>What kind of data was available (source, type, volume)? </br>
								Were there any data quality issues (missing data, noise, etc.)? </br>
								How was the data collected or accessed?</p>
							
							<h2>3. Data Processing and Exploration</h2>
							<p>How did you clean and prepare the data for analysis? </br>
								What kind of exploratory data analysis (EDA) did you perform to understand trends, patterns, or anomalies? </br>
								Were there any key findings during the data exploration phase?</p>
							
							<h2>4. Solution Development</h2>
							<p>What methods or models did you consider (machine learning algorithms, statistical models, etc.)? </br>
								Why did you choose these particular methods? </br>
								How did you fine-tune the models (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation)?</br>
								Were there any challenges in model development or implementation?</p>
							
							<h2>5. Tools and Technologies</h2>
							<p>What programming languages, libraries, or tools did you use (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, SQL, etc.)? </br>
								How did these tools help in achieving the project goals?</p>
							
							<h2>6. Results and Evaluation</h2>
							<p>What were the key outcomes (e.g., accuracy, precision, business impact)? </br>
								How did you evaluate the performance of the solution?</br>
								Were there any unexpected results, and how did you address them?</p>
							
							<h2>7. Impact / Value</h2>
							<p>What was the business impact of your solution (e.g., cost savings, efficiency gains, decision-making improvements)? </br>
								How was your solution implemented (in production or as a prototype)?</br>
								How was it received by stakeholders?</p>
							
							<h2>8. Next Steps / Improvements</h2>
							<p>Were there any limitations in your solution?</br>
								What would you improve or do differently if given more time or resources?</br>
								Are there any future plans for the project (scaling, monitoring, further development)?</p>
